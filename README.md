# Netflix-Data-Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Netflix dataset using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to uncover insights on content distribution, ratings, duration, and release trends.

##  Dataset
- Source: **Kaggle**
- Dataset: **Netflix Titles Dataset**

## Libraries Used
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

## Data Pre-Processing
The following data preprocessing steps were performed to ensure data quality and consistency:

- Dropped records with missing values in key columns (type, release_year, rating, country, duration)  
- Filtered data to separate Movies and TV Shows  
- Converted movie duration from string format to integer values  
- Cleaned and formatted columns for analysis  

## Data Visualization
The following visualizations were created to analyze Netflix data:

- Bar chart: Movies vs TV Shows distribution  
- Pie chart: Content rating distribution  
- Histogram: Movie duration distribution  
- Scatter plot: Release year vs number of shows  
- Horizontal bar chart: Top 10 countries by number of shows  
- Line plots: Comparison of Movies and TV Shows released over the years  

## Learning from the Project
Through this project, the following concepts were learned and strengthened:

- Practical data cleaning on real-world datasets  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas  
- Data visualization using Matplotlib  
- Interpreting trends and patterns from visual data
